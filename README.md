## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD & Release Management

This project utilizes GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery.

### Pull Request CI

A dedicated CI workflow (`.github/workflows/pr-ci.yml`) runs on every pull request targeting the
`main` branch. This ensures code quality and stability before merging.

This workflow performs the following actions:

* **Build Debug APK:** Compiles the Android application to produce a debug APK.

* **Run Unit Tests:** Executes all unit tests to verify application logic.

### Nightly Debug Builds

A nightly debug build and distribution workflow (`.github/workflows/nightly-debug.yml`) is
automatically triggered every day at **00:00 UTC**, or can be manually dispatched. These builds
represent the latest development changes and are distributed for internal testing.

* **Versioning:** Nightly builds are versioned using a **`YYMMDD`** format for their `versionCode` (
  e.g., `250628` for June 28, 2025) and include a `versionName` suffix like `-nightly.YYMMDD` (e.g.,
  `1.0.0-nightly.250628`). This ensures each nightly build is unique and incremental.

* **Firebase App Distribution:** Builds are seamlessly uploaded and distributed to designated tester
  groups (`testers` group is explicitly configured) via Firebase App Distribution. Testers receive
  notifications when a new nightly build is available.

* The release notes for Firebase App Distribution include details like the build date and source
  branch.
